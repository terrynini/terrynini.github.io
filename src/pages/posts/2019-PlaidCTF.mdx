Played with Balsn, and get 4th this time.
I have to construct my payload more carefully, wasted too much time on debugging.

This is not a writeup for reading, just a kind of reminder for myself.

# Misc::space saver

## Solution1

- `binwalk --dd=".*" space.dd`
- `formost` would extract the same png, but missing the most important part !!
- The password of rar is concated after the keyword `IEND` of each png

## Solution2

- mount the dd `mount -o loop space.dd /mnt/tmp`
- scan for searching deleted files

# Misc::can you guess me

## intuitive solution

also my solution

`print(vars())`

## error base

this is interesting

`help(flag)`

## intended solution

It's persuasive, because `exec`

# Misc::Project Eulernt

## Factor + random permutation and greedy

This should be more efficiency ï¼Ÿ

## Factor + dfs

This is the first thought came to my mind, did not find this solution on CTFtime's wirteup.
But the writeup released by team ranked 2nd and 3rd are this kind.
