To track the latest WebKit CVEs, we rely on Apple’s security advisories. Apple publishes a document listing security updates and Rapid Security Responses for its software: [Apple security releases – Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100). As of this writing, the most recent security content is [iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122404), where you can clearly see each CVE number alongside its corresponding WebKit Bugzilla ID.

However, most people do not have the privilegeS to view the Bugzilla entries for these security issues.

We can still locate the [specific Git commit on GitHub](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/656bcbf0bc42e3c84175614f27effc58825c69ed) by the Bugzilla ID:
<Image src="./2.png" alt='' />
But If you search for the Bugzilla ID in GitHub’s search bar, you will probably find unrelated commits:
<Image src="./3.png" alt='' />

## Answer

This happens because GitHub’s search functionality only indexes the main branch, whereas most security patches are committed to branches like `safari-7621-branch`. Therefore, the best way to find the patches you care about is to clone the entire WebKit repository and search by Git command. For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit.git
cd WebKit
git log --all --grep='id=289653'

    Animations started by a WebScrollerImpDelegateMac have a chance of using a stale ScrollerMac
    value if that delegate is replaced without invalidating the delegate's animations. Fix this by
    calling invalidate on the WebScrollerImpDelegateMac before replacing it. Ensure this type of issue
    doesn't occur by refactoring WebScrollerImpDelegateMac and WebScrollbarPartAnimationMac to use
    smart pointers.
