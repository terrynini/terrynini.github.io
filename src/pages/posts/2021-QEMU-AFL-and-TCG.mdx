Rewriting some of notes in my obsidian into a post seems to be a good idea.

## TCG

TCG is abbreviation of Tiny Code Generator, the TCG frontend lifts target instructions into TCG-IR and the TCG backend lowers the TCG-IR into host instructions. The [tcg/README](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/tree/master/tcg#readme) is a good place to start.

Because TCG-IR is relatively simple, some target instructions are hard to be implemented by pure TCG-IR. Helper functions provides another way to implement these instruction.

## Code Review

Take QEMU-5.0.0-rc4 for example, how QEMU emulating `syscall` instruction of i386 is at line 7381 of `target/i386/tcg/translate.c` :

```c target/i386/tcg/translate.c =7381
#ifdef TARGET_X86_64

    case 0x105: /* syscall */
        /* XXX: is it usable in real mode ? */
        gen_update_cc_op(s);
        gen_jmp_im(s, pc_start - s->cs_base);
        gen_helper_syscall(cpu_env, tcg_const_i32(s->pc - pc_start));
        /* TF handling for the syscall insn is different. The TF bit is  checked
           after the syscall insn completes. This allows #DB to not be
           generated after one has entered CPL0 if TF is set in FMASK.  */
        gen_eob_worker(s, false, true);
        break;

```

Functions with prefix `gen` are responsible for generating corresponding [backend-ops](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/TCG/backend-ops), but `get_helper_syscall` is more special.

The function `get_helper_syscall` will insert a call backend-op into TCG code, and the target of the call instruction is function `helper_syscall`, which is at line 979 of `target/i386/tcg/seg_helper.c`. (use `CONFIG_USER_ONLY` to choose different implementation for user mode emulation and full system emulation)

```c target/i386/tcg/seg_helper.c =979
#ifdef TARGET_X86_64
#if defined(CONFIG_USER_ONLY)
void helper_syscall(CPUX86State *env, int next_eip_addend)
{
    ...
}
#else
void helper_syscall(CPUX86State *env, int next_eip_addend)
{
	...
}
#endif
#endif
```

So, calling a custom helper function fromÂ TCG is easy, takes AFL++ for example.

## AFL++ and TCG

AFL++ is the community version of well-known coverage-based greybox fuzzer AFL, the way it used to track the code coverage during fuzzing process is to insert a instruction to call function `afl_maybe_log` at the beginning of each basic block at compile time.

The function `afl_maybe_log` will add the corresponding element by 1 in the bitmap shared with AFL++, and the way to index the bitmap is using the hash value of token of current basic block and previous basic block ( `cur_loc` and `afl_prev_loc` ), and the token value was assigned randomly at compile time.

```c
cur_loc = 0x123;
afl_area_ptr[cur_loc ^ afl_prev_loc]++;
afl_prev_loc = cur_loc >> 1;
```

In a scenario where the source code is unavailable, which is very common, it's not possible to insert `afl_maybe_log` at compile time, so AFL++ has QEMU mode to perform the so-called dynamic instrumentation.

AFL++ use it's own forked version of QEMU, [qemuafl](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/qemuafl), which will insert `afl_maybe_log` into TCG-IR while generating TCG-IR of each basic block so it can benefit from block chaining.

To add a new helper, we need to declare the helper function at `accel/tcg/tcg-runtime.h` , or if the helper only works on specific architecture, it should be declared at `target/<arch>/helper.h` .

```c accel/tcg/tcg-runtime.h
DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1(afl_maybe_log, TCG_CALL_NO_RWG, void, tl)

```

The `N` of macro `DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_N` means the number of arguments, this macro will declare a function `helper_afl_maybe_log` which returns nothing and takes one argument.

The `TCG_CALL_NO_RWG` is alias of `TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS`, it means helper does not read globals (either directly or through an exception). It implies `TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS`.

The definition of `DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1` in `exec/helper-proto.h` is:

```c exec/helper-proto.h
#define DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1(name, flags, ret, t1) \
dh_ctype(ret) HELPER(name) (dh_ctype(t1));
```

But why we need a macro only for declaration? And where it use the `flags` variable? It's actually a cool macro trick here!

Actually, the macro `DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1` was undefined  at the end of the `exec/helper-proto.h` :

```c exec/helper-proto.h
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_0
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_2
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_3
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_4
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_5
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_6
#undef DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_7

#endif /* HELPER_PROTO_H */

```

Let's take a look at `include/tcg/tcg-op.h` , which includes two files:

```c include/tcg/tcg-op.h
#include "exec/helper-proto.h"
#include "exec/helper-gen.h"
```

Surprisingly, there is another definition of `DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1` in `exec/helper-gen.h` !

```c exec/helper-gen.h
#define DEF_HELPER_FLAGS_1(name, flags, ret, t1)                        \
static inline void glue(gen_helper_, name)(dh_retvar_decl(ret)          \

    dh_arg_decl(t1, 1))                                                 \

{                                                                       \
  TCGTemp *args[1] = { dh_arg(t1, 1) }; \
  tcg_gen_callN(HELPER(name), dh_retvar(ret), 1, args); \
}

```

As we can see, this is used to define another function `gen_helper_afl_maybe_log` here. The first argument of `tcg_gen_callN` is the target of call instruction, which is `HELPER(name)` here. The macro `HELPER` is used to insert `helper_` in front of the given name. What `gen_helper_afl_maybe_log` do is to generate a call instruction to call `helper_afl_maybe_log` in TCG code !

After the declaration, next step is defining it, qemuafl defines the function `helper_afl_maybe_log` in the `accel/tcg/translate-all.c` :

```c accel/tcg/translate-all.c =71
void HELPER(afl_maybe_log)(target_ulong cur_loc)
{

    register uintptr_t afl_idx = cur_loc ^ afl_prev_loc;

    INC_AFL_AREA(afl_idx);

    afl_prev_loc = cur_loc >> 1;
}
```

Now, it's possible to call the custom function from TCG. As mentioned, AFL++ insert `afl_may_log` at the beginning of each basic block to gather the coverage information during fuzzing. Because QEMU also uses basic block as a unit while translating TCG code into host code, it's easy to  insert `afl_may_log` at the beginning of each basic block.

In the function `tb_gen_code` , we can observe that qemuafl call function `afl_gen_trace(pc)` before generating machine code:

```c accel/tcg/translate-all.c

    tcg_ctx->cpu = env_cpu(env);
    afl_gen_trace(pc);
    gen_intermediate_code(cpu, tb, max_insns);
    tcg_ctx->cpu = NULL;
    max_insns = tb->icount;

    trace_translate_block(tb, tb->pc, tb->tc.ptr);

    /* generate machine code */

```

Let's inspect the definition of `afl_gen_trace` and highlight the last three lines:

```c accel/tcg/translate-all.c
/* Generates TCG code for AFL's tracing instrumentation. */
static void afl_gen_trace(target_ulong cur_loc) {

  ...

  TCGv cur_loc_v = tcg_const_tl(cur_loc);
  gen_helper_afl_maybe_log(cur_loc_v);
  tcg_temp_free(cur_loc_v);

}
```

To use `gen_helper_afl_maybe_log` to generate a call in TCG code, the parameter have to be converted to TCG variables, `tcg_const_tl(cur_loc_v)` is used to generate a TCG temporary with value `cur_loc` , and although it's "const", it did create a temporary, we have to free it after use to reduce the memory usage.

## End

And, that's it, qemuafl inserts a call instruction at the beginning of each basic block's TCG code, once a basic block is being executed, it must call the custom helper function, `HELPER(afl_maybe_log)`, to record the code coverage first. AFL is actually using the same strategy, but I was reviewing the source code of AFL++, I use it as example here.
